  meth_rse,
  assay_number = 1,
  genomic_regions,
  genomic_regions_names = NULL,
  keep_metadata_cols = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{meth_rse}{A RangedSummarizedExperiment with methylation values.}

\item{assay_number}{The assay from meth_rse to extract values from. Default is the first assay.}

\item{genomic_regions}{GRanges object with regions to summarize methylation values for.}

\item{genomic_regions_names}{Names to give genomic_regions. Cannot be any duplicates. Default is to name them region_1, region_2, etc. if no names provided.}

\item{keep_metadata_cols}{A logical value indicating whether to add the metadata columns of genomic_regions to the output. Default is FALSE.}

\item{max_sites_per_chunk}{The approximate maximum number of methylation sites to try to load into memory at once.
The actual number loaded may vary depending on the number of methylation sites overlapping each region,
but so long as the size of any individual regions is not enormous (>= several MB), it should vary only very slightly.
Some experimentation may be needed to choose an optimal value as low values will result in increased running time,
while high values will result in a large memory footprint without much improvement in running time.
Default is floor(62500000/ncol(meth_rse)), resulting in each chunk requiring approximately 500 MB of RAM.}

\item{summary_function}{A function that summarizes column values. Default is base::colMeans.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove NA values when calculating summaries. Default value is TRUE.}

\item{n_chunks_parallel}{Number of chunks of methylation sites to process in parallel. Default is to just process a single chunk at a time.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to summary_function.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the summary of methylation of each region in genomic_regions for each sample.
